1) a simple old-fashioned for loop  (always available cross browsers, without shimming/polyfilling)
2) Array#forEach (spec | MDN) (or its relatives some, map, etc, will skip sparse values)
3) a for-of loop (ES2015+ only)
4) for-in with safeguards (Don't use it unless with safeguards, since it will also loop thru any enumerable properties in the parent, that is, the prototype chain.)

ES5 defined several other useful functions, including:
every (stops looping the first time the iterator returns false or something falsey)
some (stops looping the first time the iterator returns true or something truthy)
filter (creates a new array including elements where the filter function returns true and omitting the ones where it returns false)
map (creates a new array from the values returned by the iterator function)
reduce (builds up a value by repeated calling the iterator, passing in previous values; see the spec for the details; useful for summing the contents of an array and many other things)
reduceRight (like reduce, but works in descending rather than ascending order)
